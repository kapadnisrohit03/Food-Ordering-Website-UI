# Food Ordering Website Replication.
### This is my Food Ordering Website Replication Project using React JS, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.

To run this project first download its zip file or if you know you can clone it.
### STEP 1 - 
After downloading the zip file extract it and open it in vs code.
### STEP 2 - 
Check whether you're in the right directory and then open the terminal in VS Code.
### STEP 3 - 
Ensure that you've installed node js.
### STEP 4 - 
Run command "npm i vite@latest"
### STEP 5 - 
Then run the command " npm i" for dependencies.
### STEP 6 - 
After that, you're good to go, you can run the command "npm run dev" and the project should open in localhost.

### NOTE - 
       I've used Framer Motion for animations and Tailwind CSS, so it can throw some errors.
       Also, I've made the project in React 18 but now I've upgraded it to React 19 so it should not give any issues if it does, you can give me feedback or resolve it if you can and also you can tell me the procedure of how you did it. It will surely help me make it more easier for others to access it.
